SCORING RULES:

1. ATS Compatibility (atsScore): How well does the candidate's resume match THIS job's ATS screening?
   - Keyword overlap between resume skills/tools and job requirements
   - Title proximity (does the candidate's role history match?)
   - Years of experience alignment
   - Hard skill match (specific tools, certifications, technologies)
   - 90-100: Almost perfect keyword/skill match
   - 70-89: Strong overlap with minor gaps
   - 50-69: Transferable skills but missing key requirements
   - 0-49: Significant gaps in required skills

2. Career Enhancement (careerScore): How much does this role ADVANCE the candidate's career?
   - Does it build new skills beyond their current set?
   - Is it a step up in title/responsibility?
   - Does it diversify their industry experience?
   - Does it open new career paths?
   - 90-100: Major career leap — new skills, higher title, broader scope
   - 70-89: Meaningful growth in one or more dimensions
   - 50-69: Lateral move with some skill expansion
   - 0-49: Step back or stagnation

3. Career Outlook (outlookScore): How strong is the MARKET for this type of role?
   - Is this job title/field growing or shrinking?
   - Salary trajectory for this role type
   - Automation resistance — is AI/automation threatening this role?
   - Industry health — is this sector growing?
   - Remote/flexibility trend for this role type
   - 90-100: High-growth role in thriving industry with rising salaries
   - 70-89: Solid outlook with steady or growing demand
   - 50-69: Stable but flat growth
   - 0-49: Declining demand or high automation risk

4. Unicorn Detection (isUnicorn): Is this a NON-OBVIOUS fit?
   - Set true if the candidate would NOT normally search for this role title
   - But their transferable skills make them a strong match
   - Example: A Project Manager would be a unicorn match for "Chief of Staff", "Implementation Lead", or "Customer Success Director"
   - If isUnicorn is true, explain WHY in unicornReason
   - If isUnicorn is false, set unicornReason to null`;
